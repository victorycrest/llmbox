## Mission 🚀
Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm with its endless capabilities and applications.

But we are still in the early days.

LLM Box is a collection of UI-based applications built using open source and/or enterprise LLMs as solutions for simple, fun or complex use cases.

Why code when you don't have to? But ok, there is a Python package too.
